In this comprehensive tutorial, Dan Abramov - the creator of Redux - will teach you how to manage state in your React application with Redux.

State management is absolutely critical in providing users with a well-crafted experience with minimal bugs.

It's also one of the hardest aspects of a modern front-end application to get right.

Redux provides a solid, stable and mature solution to managing state in your React application. Through a handful of small, useful patterns, Redux can transform your application from a total mess of confusing and scattered state, into a delightfully organized, easy to understand modern JavaScript powerhouse.

The principles of Redux aren't new, but they are packaged and presented for you in an easy to use library that not only elevates your applications, but also improves your general understanding of building JavaScript UIs.

In this course, Dan Abramov will show you the fundamentals of Redux, so that you can start using it to simplify your applications.
